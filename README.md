Even after knowing that the sales are declining, he cannot do anything because he does not have the clear picture of the sales.So In order to get real insights he is more interested in a Dashboard which gives simple, understandable and digestive insight of the business.He wants to know the weakest area that the company needs to focus to increase the sales and improvise the declination.

All he wants is a simple data visualization tool which he can access on daily basis.

The team of Data Analyst (Data masters) reaches out to the software engineers to get an access to data base which they can use to create the dashboard in PowerBI.

#### In this same manner We are going to fetch the data from the database and then we are going to transform and load the data in the PowerBI to build the dashboard.
